•	The project is to write a Python program that reads a text file, scrambles the words in the file on following rules and writes the output to a new text file:
•	Words less than or equal to 3 characters need not be scrambled
•	Don't scramble first and last char, so Scrambling can become Srbmnacilg or Srbmnailcg or Snmbracilg , i.e. letters except first and last can be scrambled in any order
